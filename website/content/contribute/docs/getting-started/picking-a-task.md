Visit the [**task board**](https://github.com/GraphiteEditor/Graphite/projects/1) board and look through the current sprint's column. You are also welcome to work on tasks prioritized for upcoming sprints. Find any issues with the green "Available" tag.

Pay attention to the tags which provide some useful information like which ones are a [**Good First Issue**](https://github.com/GraphiteEditor/Graphite/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AAvailable+label%3A%22Good+First+Issue%22+) and whether they involve [**only Rust**](https://github.com/GraphiteEditor/Graphite/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3ARust+label%3AAvailable+-label%3AWeb+), [**only Web**](https://github.com/GraphiteEditor/Graphite/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AWeb+label%3AAvailable+-label%3ARust+) (HTML/CSS/TypeScript/Svelte), or [**both**](https://github.com/GraphiteEditor/Graphite/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AAvailable+label%3ARust+label%3AWeb+). Feel free to pick whatever task interests you, then comment on the issue that you would like to start. After commenting, you can dig in right away, then we will assign the issue to your GitHub user to keep the work status of tasks organized.

Writing new documentation by commenting existing code is another valuable way to contribute as you learn.
